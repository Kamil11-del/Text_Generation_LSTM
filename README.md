# Text Generation with LSTM
In this project, we built a text generation model using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The main objective of this model is to generate text sequences based on a given input seed text. Here's a step-by-step description of the process:

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:

We started by collecting a dataset of text, which consists of headlines or articles.
The text data was cleaned by removing punctuation and converting all characters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
The cleaned text was then tokenized, where each unique word in the text was assigned a unique integer value.
We generated input sequences by splitting the text into smaller sequences that the model can learn from.
Sequence Padding:

Since LSTM models require input sequences to be of the same length, we padded the sequences with zeros at the beginning to ensure consistency.
Building the LSTM Model:

**An LSTM-based neural network was constructed using the following layers:**
Embedding Layer: This layer converts the input tokens into dense vectors of fixed size, capturing semantic information about the words.
LSTM Layer: This layer processes the sequences, learning the temporal dependencies between words.
Dropout Layer: This layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
Dense Output Layer: The final layer uses a softmax activation function to predict the probability distribution of the next word in the sequence.
Training the Model:

The model was compiled using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
It was trained on the prepared sequences to learn the relationships between words in the text.
Generating Text:

After training, the model can generate new text by predicting the next word in a sequence.
Starting with a seed text, the model generates one word at a time, which is appended to the sequence, and this process continues for a specified number of words.
Visualization:

The performance of the model during training was visualized by plotting the loss and accuracy over epochs.
This helped in understanding how well the model was learning over time.
